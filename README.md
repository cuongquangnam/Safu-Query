# Telegram Bot
- This is my work at Binance SAFU Hackathon - a 32-hour hackathon: https://www.binancefair.com/safu-hackathon/, where I am in a team with other 2 people to create a Telegram bot to reply to query about whether an account or a link is malicious or not. I am assigned with design the UX part.
- The main codes are in src\main folder. You need the libraries from this link: https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots to run the codes.
- To use the bot on Telegram, simply searching for the word overtherainbow and then interact with it.
