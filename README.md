# Telegram Bot
- This is my uncompleted work at Binance SAFU Hackathon - a 32-hour hackathon: https://www.binancefair.com/safu-hackathon/, where I was in a team with other 2 people to create a Telegram bot to reply to query about whether an account or a link is malicious or not. I am assigned designing the UX part. (note that the codes here is just the front-end)
- The main codes are in src\main folder. You need the libraries from this link: https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots to run the codes.
- The bot's name is overtherainbow, simply search for it on Telegram and start playing!
